# Projects

A small showcase of some projects I completed as a student at the Ohio State University.

# Core Interpreter

An interpreter for the basic programming language CORE written in Python. This project showcases programming skills in Python to create
a tokenizer and interpreter, understanding of polymorphism and object oriented design, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of
programming languages as well as a compiler/interpreter that parses in a recursive descent style. 
More information can be found in the respective READMEs of those folders.

# Grocery Store Database

A linked-list database written in C that showcases data structure design and pointer manipulation. This project was designed with
multiple stages of pointer dereferencing in mind in order to familiarize students with core concepts relating to low-level languages.
More information can be found in the README for that project.

# Legend of Zelda Remake

A recreation of the first two dungeons from the Legend of Zelda game for the NES written in C# under the monogame framework. This
project was worked on by myself and 4 others over the course of the semester following AGILE development principles. My main focus on
this project was the collision detection and handling as well as attempts to architect the program for scalability and reusability
utilzing object oriented design as well as other programming paradigms such as singleton factories.
Some files, such as the room generating files and sprite assets, have been compressed or removed.
