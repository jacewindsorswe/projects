This project showcases code written in C to create and manage a grocery store database via a linked list data structure.
The guidelines to this project required methods be a maximum of 10 executed lines, providing
more readability and easier debugging.
The main purpose of this project was to get comfortable with reference and pointers, with the instructor intentionally
designing the project around the use of a quadruple pointer. Other areas of focus were debugging using GDB, generation
of data structures from exising files, and database management.
